# spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project we have implemented an AWS-hosted ETL pipeline using the Spotify API (spotipy) to extract album, artist, and song data. It transforms and loads the data into SNOWFLAKE Data Warehouse tables using Snowpipe, ensuring efficient data management and analysis.
